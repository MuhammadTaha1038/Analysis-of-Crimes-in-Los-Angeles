##  Project Overview
This project analyzes crime data in Los Angeles using Python. The dataset provides insights into crime trends, victim demographics, and geographic crime distribution.

##  Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is publicly available from Los Angeles Open Data. It contains information such as:

- Crime occurrence date and time
- Crime type and description
- Victim demographics (age, sex, descent)
- Crime location and area details

###  Dataset Format
The dataset is now compressed into a ZIP file for easier storage and downloading. Please extract the ZIP file before loading it into your analysis.

##  Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Importing necessary libraries
   - Extracting and loading the dataset
   - Checking for missing values and handling inconsistencies

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics and data distribution
   - Visualizing crime frequency by type, time, and location
   - Correlation analysis and outlier detection

3. **Insights & Findings**
   - Most common crime types in Los Angeles
   - Crime distribution by area and time
   - Patterns in victim demographics

##  Visualizations
The analysis includes:
- Bar charts of crime frequency by type
- Heatmaps showing crime density
- Time-series analysis of crime trends

##  How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
